            <h3>What to Expect</h3>
            <p>Contact me for a free intake consultation by clicking below. This initial conversation is an introduction to get a sense if we are a good fit to work together.</p>
            <p>As a registered provisional psychologist, I am trained in a range of evidence-based therapies and techniques to help individuals overcome a variety of mental health concerns, including anxiety, depression, trauma, and relationship issues. With a compassionate and non-judgmental approach, I work closely with clients to tailor therapy to their specific needs and goals.</p>
            <p>Appointments are 50 minutes and can be arranged in person, in our Leduc office, online via Zoom or over the phone.</p>
            <p>I have a strong person-centred approach and work to support you in exploring the challenges in your life. </p>
